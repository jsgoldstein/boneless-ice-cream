Welcome to GitHub, Opp. This is where most of the code in the world lives. I think. I figured it would be easy to leave our code here. Hopefully you can add code here soon.

This is all still a work in progress, but I think this is a good place to start.

## Lesson plan
1. intro
2. if's
3. functions
4. for loops
5. while loops
6. classes
