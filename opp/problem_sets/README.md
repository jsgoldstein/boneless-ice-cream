# Problem Sets

These are the problem sets. They are numbered one at a time.
They are here you to help practice. Whether you buy into it or not, the problem sets are your friends.

The problem sets are numbered. It is not always going to be the case that the easiest set will have the smallest number.

## How This Works
There are two files for each problem set. 

1. The first is called `set_n.py` where `n` is some number.
Example: [set_1.py](set_1.py)

2. The second is called `test_set_n.py` where, again `n` is some number.
Example: [test_set_1.py](test_set_1.py)

You will be editing the code in the `set` files, not the `test` files.

### Goal
There are functions that are defined. These functions need to be implemented.

That is where you come in.

Each function needs to be implemented.
Using the input parameters and the description at the beginning of the function, you will have a pretty good idea of what to do.

When you think you are done, you can test your code. To do that, you will run the test suite.

### How To Run The Test Suite
`python -m pytest test_set_1.py`

This will tell you which tests are failing and which are passing and why.

Please note that there are not a bajillion million tests. It is possible that I under-engineered the tests and we are missing corner cases.
This is both because I am a human and I am lazy.
AND because at some point this will be your responsibility as well.
You will have to come up with good tests. A smart programmer, like you, will write the tests first, and then the code.

Good luck.
